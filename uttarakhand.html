            <h3>3 Jim Corbett</h3>
            <p>
               Jim Corbett, also known as Edward James Corbett, was a British-Indian hunter, naturalist, and conservationist. He was born on July 25, 1875, in Nainital, Uttarakhand, India, and is best known for his efforts in wildlife conservation and his writings on the subject.
               Corbett spent a significant part of his life in the jungles of the Kumaon region, particularly in the present-day Jim Corbett National Park, which was later named in his honor. He became renowned for his skills as a hunter and tracker, known for tracking and hunting down man-eating tigers and leopards that posed a threat to human lives and livelihoods.
               However, over time, Corbett's perspective on wildlife changed, and he became a strong advocate for the protection and conservation of wildlife. He realized the importance of preserving the natural habitats of animals and worked towards raising awareness about the need for conservation.
               Corbett's experiences and encounters with wildlife inspired him to write several books, including "Man-Eaters of Kumaon," "The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag," and "The Temple Tiger and More Man-Eaters of Kumaon." These books gained international acclaim and established Corbett as a celebrated author and conservationist.

            <h3>4 Gangotri</h3>
            <p> Gangotri is known as the origin of the holy River Ganges, which is considered one of the most sacred rivers in Hinduism. According to Hindu mythology, it is believed that Goddess Ganga descended to Earth at Gangotri after rigorous penance performed by King Bhagirath to cleanse the sins of his ancestors.
               The main attraction in Gangotri is the Gangotri Temple, dedicated to Goddess Ganga. The temple, constructed in the 18th century, is a popular pilgrimage site for Hindus. It is open for devotees from late April to early November, as the region experiences heavy snowfall during the winter months, making it inaccessible.
               Apart from the temple, Gangotri offers breathtaking views of the surrounding snow-covered peaks, pristine landscapes, and the Bhagirathi River. The region is known for its natural beauty and is popular among nature lovers, trekkers, and adventure enthusiasts.
               To reach Gangotri, one has to travel by road from Rishikesh or Dehradun. The route takes you through picturesque valleys and scenic landscapes. Accommodation options in Gangotri include guesthouses and ashrams that cater to the needs of pilgrims and tourists.
